                                              Preamble

Technology is an integral part of everyday life. An Engineering education in Information
Technology gives broad exposure to various technical subjects that develop skills that are
transferable to most industries such as problem solving, decision making, innovation, project
management, team working and communication which will contribute to a rapidly changing
technological environment.

Academic Autonomy conferred by the University of Mumbai from the Academic Year 2014-15,
gave us the freedom to develop and implement our own curriculum KJSCE2014 with features such
as inclusion of choice based Interdisciplinary Course (IDC), Audit Courses, Add on Credit Courses,
Add on Audit Courses, Exposure Courses, etc. Our revision in syllabus KJSCE2018, was
introduced from the academic year 2018-19, has been designed based on the revised AICTE
guidelines as well as various accrediting bodies. Some of the highlights of the KJSCE2018 syllabus
are: more focus on hands on, wide choice for branch specific electives, more number of open or
interdisciplinary electives, streamlined courses based on thrust areas, increased opportunity for
internships, etc. Laboratory courses like Programming labs will enhance the practical skills of the
students.

With the formulation of Somaiya Vidyavihar University, the curriculum of SVU 2020 started from
the academic year 2020-2021. Some of the highlights are introduction of Minor degree, Honor
degree. More option for programming Laboratory courses including a course of Competitive
Programming laboratories to prepare the students better in terms of programming skills.

We at IT department of KJSCE endeavor continuously to enable our students to move forward and
confidently embrace change rather than follow; to innovate rather than stagnate and to initiate
rather respond to become efficient technocrats and dynamic entrepreneurs.

                                                                                               Dr. Irfan Siddavatam

Course prerequisites: Fundamentals of Computer Programming

Course Objectives:
This course provides an understanding of the concepts and mechanisms underlying the
telecommunications and networking. Starting with the basics of data communication and types
of networks, it introduces the transmission media. It also explains how two public networks,
telephones and cable TV can be used for data transfer. A thorough background of the ISO- OSI
model and the TCP/IP model will be given. The Application layer, Transport layer, Internet
layer, Data link layer and Physical layers are covered in detail along with the protocols used.
Top-down approach is used for this course will give students a better perception in terms of both
usefulness and ease of understanding.

Course Outcomes
At the end of successful completion of the course the student will be able to

   CO1 . Understand the data communication systems, network topologies and network
           devices

   CO2. Enumerate the layers of the OSI model and TCP/IP model, their functions and
           Protocols.

   CO3. Build the skills of sub-netting and routing mechanisms.
   CO4. Execute their knowledge of computer communication principles, including

           Error detection and correction, multiplexing, flow control, and error control.
